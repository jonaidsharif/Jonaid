Hi. Iâ€™m Jonaid Sharif. I build lots of demos on these templates and the @jonaidsharif profile portfolio website. Most of them are spending time on programming contests and bug finding, besides learning Cyber Security. 
I work at seldev academy as a Junior Web Developer. For more information about me (and a whole lot of shenanigans), check out jonaid.com.
Thank youâ€¦. JBS
